Llanne UI is an open-source project, ready-to-use React.js components library that facilitates the development of React.js frontend applications and websites, natively compatible with mobile device screens and dark/light themes. The idea of developing a standard UI framework for React.js and TypeScript comes from my own need for standardising UI components across different applications for a consistent cross-platform UI/UX and an efficient way to update multiple frontend UIs all at once. The library is conceived in a way that desktop browser applications should be automatically compatible with mobile view, without any need for refactoring or working with different components for different screen sizes.

## Install Llane UI

You can install LLane UI by running:
```shell
npm install
```

## Build Llane UI

You can build Llane UI by running the following command:
```shell
npm run build
```

This will compile Llane UI to your `/dist` folder, which will then be used by your application to import the Llane UI components.

## Testing Llane UI

You can run the test TSX page by using the following command:
```shell
npm run test
```

This will open a test page in your `localhost` with all the available components rendered. You can use this to make modifications to the components and test them in real-time.

## Building Test Application

You can also crete an optimised build of the test application - even though I'm not sure why you would ðŸ¤· - by running the following command:
```shell
npm run deploy-test-app
```

This should create an optimised build in your `/build` folder.

## How to use it with my React App?

### Regular Usage With NPM

You can use `npm` to install the latest stable release of `llane-ui` dependency in your React App:
```shell
npm install llane-ui --save-dev
```

### Fetch From GitHub (Unstable)
You can add the latest unstable version of Llane UI to your React App dependency tree by adding the following line to your `package.json` file (under dependencies):

```json
"llane-ui": "git+https://github.com/znx-x/llane-ui.git"
```

This will import and build Llane UI with your application. **Only use this method in non-production applications and be aware of the risks (including breaking risks) inherent from these unstable versions.**

### Using Llane UI

After installing it, you can use Llane UI components by importing and declaring them in your `JSX` or `TSX`. For exaple:

```js
import { Heading } from 'llane-ui';

/* Your Code */

return(
    <>
      <Heading>
        This is a Llane UI Heading.
      </Heading>
    </>
)
```

## How do I build a custom icon library?

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to have **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** installed to build your custom icon library.

By default, LLane UI uses a pre-compiled set of **[react-feather](https://feathericons.com/)** icons with some additions, but you can add, remove, or customise the icon library with your own `.svg` files. Follow the steps below to build your custom icon library:

1. Add, remove, and customise your `.svg` files inside the `/src/Icons/library` folder. You will need to adhere to the Kebab-Case naming convention when naming or renaming your files. Alternatively, you can adjust the `build-icon-library.py` script to fit your naming style if you prefer not to use Kebab-Case.
2. Inside the root folder, execute the `build-icon-library.py` script to build your library:
    ```shell
    python build-icon-library.py
    ```
3. Now, you will need to rebuild the LLane UI framework to compile the new library and incorporate the new export structure:
    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

This process will update the `/dist` folder, creating all the new icons and a new export structure that you can use in your project.
